# odin-inventory-app

An Inventory App from The Odin Project.

By building from scratch, this will help solidify my recent learning of Node, Express, ejs for views, the Model View Controller (MVC) design pattern, forms and data handling using express-validator and PostgreSQL for the database.

The app is hosted on railway.

Although this project was for intended an inventory management app for an imaginary shop, such as for groceries or car parts, I decided to create the app for an arcade bar!

An arcade bar is a place to go with friends to drink and play classic arcade video games, like Flynn's Arcade in the Tron films!

I got this inspiration from NQ64 arcade bar in London which I recently went to and had a great trip down memory lane, playing classic N64 and the original xbox games.

The games in this app are all my favourite video games I've played over the years.
